1. What is a repository-based system and why is it important?
A repository-based system is a centralized place where source code and related resources are stored and managed. It helps in version control, collaboration, and tracking changes effectively during software development.

2. What did you learn from resolving the plugin conflict?
I learned the importance of resolving merge conflicts in collaborative development. It taught me how changes made by different people in the same file can be merged manually using Git.

3. How can dependency conflicts impact system stability?
Dependency conflicts can lead to broken builds, unexpected behavior, or security issues. Using the correct versions ensures the app runs smoothly and is compatible with its dependencies.
